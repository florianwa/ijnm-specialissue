  In recent years, the heterogeneity and variability of Internet applications - whether in the multimedial or 
  interactive environment - has increased significantly. Nowadays, video streaming is responsible for a 
  large portion of all bandwidth on the Internet, and Internet telephony and video conferencing systems 
  have become part of our daily life. At the same time, the Internet of Things (IoT) strives for the first place 
  in terms of the number of devices, and smartphones and tablets contribute to the ever-growing demands 
  on the networks. Among other things, the spread of web browsing and web-based services allows for 
  increasing acceptance and development of video games, upcoming virtual reality applications, 360° video 
  and much more.
